# Advance-Calculator

This program runs in WPF and does advance mathematical calculations not just the simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The window form will show the orientation of each calculation. The UI design is very simple and straight to the point with to fancy gimmick. You can add functionality if you like when you copy the code and further enhance the UI's presentation to your liking
